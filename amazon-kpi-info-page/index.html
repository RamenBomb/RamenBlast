    <h1>Amazon KPI Dashboard App</h1>
    <p>
      This is a private application developed and operated by a single Amazon seller. The app connects to the Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API) to retrieve performance data related to product sales, advertising, and customer metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the app is to track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as TACoS, ROAS, conversion rates, sessions, and net profit, per ASIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Amazon customer information is stored or processed. Data is retrieved solely for internal use by the developer on their own seller account.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Amazon Information is stored securely using Google Firebase services (Firestore database), and access is restricted to the developer only. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app does not share any Amazon Information with outside parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For questions or compliance inquiries, please contact the developer at: <strong>joey@tryramenbomb.com</strong>
